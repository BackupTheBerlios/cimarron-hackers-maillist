Marcos got me fixed on them! It's his fault! :-)
OK, I got it. I somehow got the idea that they were pretty much
omnipresent in Cimarr&#243;n, and started using them for just about anything,
let's say to keep things orthogonal. Now I'm a bit wiser.

&gt;<i> and that's it. In fact, the text in the tutorial that says &quot;It is
</I>&gt;<i> important to note that attributes that are to be under the control

OK, fixed.

&gt;<i> right, you should either inherit from model.base.Model (it's in
</I>&gt;<i> examples/person for now, but probably should go elsewhere if we
</I>&gt;<i> decide it's worth it: it really is very trivial as it stands) which
</I>&gt;<i> will give you fairly obvious getattr/setattr methods, or implement
</I>&gt;<i> your own (again, very trivial: look at model.base.Model).
</I>
Well, you tell me what's better... Because we must either tell future
users that they ought to define this trivial access mode, or that they
have to inherit from that class.

&gt;<i> here, take a look at simplepersoneditor.py as it stands now (I'm
</I>&gt;<i> comitting this so you get it, but feel free to roll back the changes
</I>&gt;<i> if you disagree):
</I>
I don't disagree, but the code seems to do it for me: it doesn't work.
To actually make it work, you have to call |foo.commitValue()| on each
widget in the |checkValues()| method. I think this is not what we want.
The idea behind the target thing is that it should allow the programmer
to just assign a target to a control, and then just plain forget about
it. Any changes made to the object are active immediately (for Entry
instances, for example, on losing focus). Of course, there may be a an
&quot;Apply&quot; button somewhere in advanced screens, which would apply the
changes to the database. But you should not need to do the step of
calling |commitValues()| on all widgets for it.

There are a number of disadvantages to the current approach. Off the top
of my head, if an &quot;Apply&quot; button has to call |commitValue()| on each
widget, then it will effectively change the values of all the objects in
the view, regardless of whether the user changed them or not. This can't
be good. It also adds to the complexity of the program, without adding
any useful functionality. So I think |commitValue()| has to go, and be
replaced by immediate change of the object value.

I have left |checkValues()| as it was (i.e. without the calls to the
method |commitValues()|) because that is the way I think it ought to
work. Please change the control's behavior to work with the code, or
tell me why |commitValues()| is necessary.
