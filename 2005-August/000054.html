You didn't give us much chance, did you? In any case, please note that
my previous mail was about two issues (my bad)
      * validation
      * subclassing within the model

Your proposal and this answer deal with the validation issue. I will
write another on the subclassing issue.

&gt;<i> Keep in mind also that there are two kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> accesses to a Model: internal, via direct attribute manipulation (as
</I>&gt;<i> in the __init__), and external, *which only happens via
</I>&gt;<i> getattr/setattr methods*.
</I>
Well... this may not be *entirely* true. Objects within the model may
interact among them, setting each other's attribute values in activity
triggered by the user changing the value of just one of them. So while
it is true that *user* manipulation only happens through
getattr/setattr, it is not true that any other manipulation can happen
only within the class itself.

&gt;<i> What kind of validation do we mean? Or, what kind do we want or
</I>&gt;<i> need? One kind whose solution leaps to mind is to validate external
</I>&gt;<i> modifications only, i.e. to have
</I>&gt;<i>     class Model(object):
</I>&gt;<i>         def setattr(self, attr, value):
</I>&gt;<i>             self.validate(attr, value)
</I>&gt;<i>             setattr(self, attr, value)
</I>
This would work. I have a concern here that self.validate would have to
be programmed in a very clever way, to avoid leaving the programmer with
the task of dispatching the validation code corresponding to the
attribute through a long chain of &quot;if&quot; statements.

&gt;<i> Another kind is validating all modifications. This can be done with
</I>&gt;<i> a bit of python magic (only a bit):
</I>&gt;<i>     class Model(object):
</I>&gt;<i>         def __setattr__(self, attr, value):
</I>&gt;<i>             self.validate(attr, value)
</I>&gt;<i>             super(Model, self).__setattr__(attr, value)
</I>&gt;<i>         def setattr(self, attr, value):
</I>&gt;<i>             setattr(self, attr, value)
</I>&gt;<i> whether we need this much validation is debatable, but it's simple
</I>&gt;<i> enough to do if we do.
</I>
This is probably overkill... or not. Actually, good practice mandates
that parameters always be checked for validity as early as possible, so
it wouldn't be bad to do it. However, I find it hard to guesstimate the
overhead such a strict validation policy would entail. Maybe it would be
nice if we could turn such a feature on while debugging, and leaving it
out in production.

&gt;<i> Both these validation schemes have (at least) a problem, which isn't
</I>&gt;<i> present in Modeling's way of doing validation: it requires validity
</I>&gt;<i> all the time. There are situations where your object must transition
</I>&gt;<i> past an invalid state to reach a valid state.
</I>
Good point. A good example of this would be a Triangle object, specified
by the lengths of its sides. If you stretch the lines one by one, it is
possible for the object to temporarily not be a valid triangle, but to
turn back to one after all the changes have been done. However, you do
not have to wait till the end of all changes to know that there is a
validation problem if someone tries to set the length of one side to
&quot;avocado&quot;.

These are, actually, two stages of validation: one is syntactic, the
other is semantic. We cannot do semantic validation until the users
signals she's done. But we can ensure that numeric values actually get
numbers assigned, that entered dates actually exist in the calendar,
etc. We can even check that numbers are within a certain range, or that
strings are of a certain form. We don't need to wait for semantic
validation to flag these, and we shouldn't.

The way I see it, the widget must be able to cope with the model
completely rejecting a value for some reason, and to stop the user in
her tracks to correct the mistake just then and there. Then, the
window's controller must have a separate mechanism to ask the model for
structural validation once the user asks for commit.
