&gt;<i> While working on the tutorial, I feel that there are a few functions
</I>&gt;<i> that we must implement soon, for their need is pretty much obvious.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      1. Deleting rows from Grids: We can now create rows, and edit
</I>&gt;<i>         existing rows, but we cannot get rid of a row. This
</I>&gt;<i>         functionality is so basic that we need a general mechanism for
</I>&gt;<i>         handling it. Maybe a simple trashcan icon at the end of each row
</I>&gt;<i>         will be easy enough. Probably this functionality can be turned
</I>&gt;<i>         on and off with a flag, but I feel that it should be better if
</I>&gt;<i>         we had separate classes EditableGrid and SelectionGrid, since
</I>&gt;<i>         their behaviors are bound to be subtly different. EditableGrid
</I>&gt;<i>         should have at least the following delegation methods:
</I>&gt;<i>               * def will_edit_row_col(self, grid, row, col)
</I>&gt;<i>               * def did_edit_row_col(self, grid, row, col)
</I>&gt;<i>               * def will_delete_row(self, grid, row)
</I>&gt;<i>               * def did_delete_row(self, grid)
</I>&gt;<i>               * def will_add_row(self, grid)
</I>&gt;<i>               * def did_add_row(self, grid, row)
</I>
although deleting a row might be more than you're able to do right now
due to time constraints, you could add tests to try and delete rows
(these tests will fail, but they'll serve to remind us). Similarly,
you could add tests for the expected behavior upon delegation (both
affirmative and negative)...

&gt;<i>      3. Status bar: the more I think about it, the more necessary a
</I>&gt;<i>         status bar for each window looks, especially for non-intrusive
</I>&gt;<i>         error reporting. For data-entry-intensive applications, error
</I>&gt;<i>         panels are not an option: they disrupt the normal flow of the
</I>&gt;<i>         task, demand specific actions for their dismissal, etc. We had a
</I>&gt;<i>         very nice, functional status bar in the previous Cimarr&#243;n
</I>&gt;<i>         drafts, I think we should bring it back from the dead. Controls
</I>&gt;<i>         ought to be able to find it and use it to display validation
</I>&gt;<i>         errors. A status bar may be harder to find than a panel for a
</I>&gt;<i>         novice user, but they're the way to go for experienced users. To
</I>&gt;<i>         have the best of both worlds, the status bar can be configured
</I>&gt;<i>         to pop up timed error and warning panels when the priority of
</I>&gt;<i>         the message is above a certain configurable threshold. That way,
</I>&gt;<i>         novices can have their panels, and experienced users a less
</I>&gt;<i>         intrusive mechanism. Since it would centralize this kind of
</I>&gt;<i>         communications with the user, the status bar can also remember
</I>&gt;<i>         which messages it has shown, thus providing better debugging
</I>&gt;<i>         information.
</I>
One question: should the statusbar be 'global', do you think?
