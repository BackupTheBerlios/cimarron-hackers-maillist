<PRE>While working on the tutorial, I feel that there are a few functions
that we must implement soon, for their need is pretty much obvious.

     1. Deleting rows from Grids: We can now create rows, and edit
        existing rows, but we cannot get rid of a row. This
        functionality is so basic that we need a general mechanism for
        handling it. Maybe a simple trashcan icon at the end of each row
        will be easy enough. Probably this functionality can be turned
        on and off with a flag, but I feel that it should be better if
        we had separate classes EditableGrid and SelectionGrid, since
        their behaviors are bound to be subtly different. EditableGrid
        should have at least the following delegation methods:
              * def will_edit_row_col(self, grid, row, col)
              * def did_edit_row_col(self, grid, row, col)
              * def will_delete_row(self, grid, row)
              * def did_delete_row(self, grid)
              * def will_add_row(self, grid)
              * def did_add_row(self, grid, row)
     2. Data validation: this is extremely basic. Controls should be
        able to handle ValueError exceptions raised by the model. The
        exception must be able to provide a user-readable error message
        parameter, which the Control must somehow bring to the user's
        attention (see Status Bar below). After the exception, the
        widget must cancel the editing operation that was in course, and
        expect further input from the user.
     3. Status bar: the more I think about it, the more necessary a
        status bar for each window looks, especially for non-intrusive
        error reporting. For data-entry-intensive applications, error
        panels are not an option: they disrupt the normal flow of the
        task, demand specific actions for their dismissal, etc. We had a
        very nice, functional status bar in the previous Cimarr&#243;n
        drafts, I think we should bring it back from the dead. Controls
        ought to be able to find it and use it to display validation
        errors. A status bar may be harder to find than a panel for a
        novice user, but they're the way to go for experienced users. To
        have the best of both worlds, the status bar can be configured
        to pop up timed error and warning panels when the priority of
        the message is above a certain configurable threshold. That way,
        novices can have their panels, and experienced users a less
        intrusive mechanism. Since it would centralize this kind of
        communications with the user, the status bar can also remember
        which messages it has shown, thus providing better debugging
        information.
