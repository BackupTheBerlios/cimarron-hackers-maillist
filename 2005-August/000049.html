Indeed.

hold it. Let's look at some code, as it would stand right now (i.e.
given current interfaces), shall we?

Say we have a very simple model:

    class Simple(Model):
        def __init__(self, anAttribute=None):
            self.anAttribute = anAttribute

access from Cimarr&#243;n to the model is done via the IModel interface,
in other words, if an instance of Simple is the target of a Control
whose attibute is 'anAttribute', the Control will do

    self.target.getattr(self.attribute)

to fetch the value, and

    self.target.setattr(self.attribute, value)

to store the value. And that's it, that's all the interface
currently says. Keep in mind also that there are two kinds of
accesses to a Model: internal, via direct attribute manipulation (as
in the __init__), and external, *which only happens via
getattr/setattr methods*.

How is setattr currently implemented? Well, if we ignore the fact
that the attribute can actually be a path, it's basically this:

    class Model(object):
        def setattr(self, attr, value):
            setattr(self, attr, value)

ok. So that's the situation, as it stands. Now, let's think about
validation.

What kind of validation do we mean? Or, what kind do we want or
need? One kind whose solution leaps to mind is to validate external
modifications only, i.e. to have

    class Model(object):
        def setattr(self, attr, value):
            self.validate(attr, value)
            setattr(self, attr, value)

and have |validate| raise the appropriate exception if the value is
invalid.

Another kind is validating all modifications. This can be done with
a bit of python magic (only a bit):

    class Model(object):
        def __setattr__(self, attr, value):
            self.validate(attr, value)
            super(Model, self).__setattr__(attr, value)
        def setattr(self, attr, value):
            setattr(self, attr, value)

whether we need this much validation is debatable, but it's simple
enough to do if we do.

Both these validation schemes have (at least) a problem, which isn't
present in Modeling's way of doing validation: it requires validity
all the time. There are situations where your object must transition
past an invalid state to reach a valid state. One way around this
would be to use pre-commit validation as merely informative, i.e.
let the model be invalid but notify the user. As it's a notification
and not an error, I think I wouldn't actually raise an exception
(although again this is debatable), but rather something like

    class Model(object):
        def setattr(self, attr, value):
            setattr(self, attr, value)
            return self.validate(attr, value)

here validate would return -- for example -- None (as it does
currently) for valid, and some message for invalid, and the Control
would notify the user using this return value. Or it could return a
string-like value that was False when non-'Ok'... yeah, that might
be even better

    class ValidityMessage(unicode):
        def __nonzero__(self):
            return self == 'Ok'

so the Control could do

    valid = self.target.setattr(self.attribute, value)
    if not valid:
        self.window.statusbar.warn(valid)
        self.paint_in_garish_colours_so_user_notices()

would this be (a) sufficient, and (b) easy to use and modify?
